# Operate First toolbox

This is a Operate-First toolbox that comprises of commonly used tooling to supplement workflows.

## Usage

### Install the toolbox command

You will need the [toolbox][] command. If you are on a recent Fedora, you can:

```
dnf install toolbox
```

Or you can grab a [release][] and install the `toolbox` script in your `$PATH`
manually.

[toolbox]: https://github.com/containers/toolbox
[release]: https://github.com/containers/toolbox/releases

### Create your toolbox container

```shell
$ toolbox create --image quay.io/aicoe/of-toolbox:v0.1.0
Created container: of-toolbox
Enter with: toolbox enter --container of-toolbox-v0.1.0
$
```

This will create a container called `of-toolbox-<version-id>`.

### Enter the toolbox

```shell
$ toolbox enter --container of-toolbox-v0.1.0
```

### Tools included

- Kustomize
- SOPS
- KSOPS
- Helm
- Helm Secrets

### Debugging Tips

You may see the following error when running a `kustomize build` using `ksops`:

> plugin was built with a different version of package internal/cpu

Toolbox will try to absorb as much from your parent environment as possible, this may result in environment variables
in the toolbox being overwritten by your own environment. Try sourcing these environment variables again to fix the issue
above:

```bash
XDG_DATA_HOME=/usr/share/.local/share
XDG_CACHE_HOME=/usr/share/.cache
XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/usr/share/.config
```
